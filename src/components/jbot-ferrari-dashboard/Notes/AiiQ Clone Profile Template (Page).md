What This Unlocks:
A clone isn’t “just an assistant.” It’s a brand ambassador, a knowledge worker, and a community node.

Members feel ownership over their AI and celebrate its growth.

Badges + metrics = a status layer that drives participation and trust.

Sponsors (lenders, vendors, tool providers) can align with top clones for visibility.


🔜 Next (When You’re Ready):
I can scaffold any of these components individually. Suggested order:

AssistantHeader – bio + avatar + aesthetic

AssistantStats – badges, success counters

CloneThinktank – introspective chat panel

AskBox – secured messaging or anonymous submission

SponsorButton – future revenue integration
